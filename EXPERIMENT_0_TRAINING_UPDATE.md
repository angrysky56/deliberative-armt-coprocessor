# Experiment 0 Training Phase - Update Summary

## What Changed

Added a **training phase** to Experiment 0 that trains all three model configurations before evaluation. This gives us real signal about architectural differences.

## New Workflow (7 Steps Total)

1. **Initialize Models** - Create Config A, B, and C
2. **Verify Parameters** - Ensure fair comparison
3. **Generate Synthetic Tasks** - Memory, Pattern, Multi-hop
4. **🆕 TRAIN MODELS** - 200 training steps on all tasks
5. **Evaluate Performance** - Test on synthetic tasks
6. **Analyze Results** - Compare task performance
7. **Final Recommendation** - Including training efficiency analysis

## Training Details

- **Training Steps**: 200 (takes ~5-10 minutes on GPU, ~30 minutes on CPU)
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4 (same for all configs)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW (same for all configs)
- **Training Schedule**: Rotates through all 3 tasks (memory, pattern, multi-hop)
- **Progress Reporting**: Every 50 steps

## New Metrics

### Training Efficiency
- Measures how much each model learns (loss reduction %)
- Helps identify if dual architecture learns faster/better
- Format: `(initial_loss - final_loss) / initial_loss * 100`

### Enhanced Recommendation Logic
Now considers BOTH:
1. **Final Task Performance** (who does better after training?)
2. **Learning Efficiency** (who learns faster?)

## Possible Outcomes

### ✅ **PROCEED**
- Dual beats unified by >5% on reasoning
- Maintains memory performance
- → Green light for coprocessor development

### ⚠️ **MARGINAL** 
- Small gains (2-5%) but better learning efficiency
- → Suggests may scale better with more training
- → Test on real benchmarks first

### 🔍 **INVESTIGATE**
- Good learning efficiency but similar final performance
- → May need more training or better suited for different tasks
- → Test on BABILong/GSM8K

### ❌ **PIVOT_TO_UNIFIED**
- Unified matches or beats dual architecture
- No learning efficiency advantage
- → Focus on improving unified ARMT instead

## What to Look For in Results

1. **Training Curves**: Does Config C (dual) learn faster than Config B (unified)?
2. **Task Performance**: Does Config C outperform Config B after training?
3. **Memory vs Reasoning Trade-off**: Does each excel at different tasks?
4. **Learning Efficiency**: Does Config C show >5% better learning efficiency?

## Expected Runtime

- **With GPU (CUDA)**: ~5-10 minutes
- **With CPU**: ~30-45 minutes

## Next Steps After Results

Depending on the outcome, we'll either:
- ✅ Proceed with adaptive triggers (MeCo, ARS)
- ⚠️ Test on real benchmarks first
- 🔍 Investigate architectural modifications
- ❌ Pivot to unified architecture focus

**Run the experiment:**
```bash
python experiments/experiment_0_architecture_validation.py
```

The results will now have **real signal** from trained models! 🚀
